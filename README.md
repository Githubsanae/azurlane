# Azur Lane
I've refactored the code logic to fix the crashing issue <br>

This translation service is weak and can't express my meaning correctly, so I won't explain how to fix it <br>
# Feature
* Add some other features to Perseus' original Feature (source code from 4pii4/PiePerseus), as described in Releases
# MOD MENU APK
* [click here](MOD_MENU_APK.md)
# How to use
* The MOD has been changed to a MOD MENU format. Specific usage instructions are available in the releases section.
* Actually my library doesn't need context support, if you know which methods will be loaded first after the game starts, you can also load my library in that method with the same effect
