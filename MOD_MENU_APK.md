# MOD MENU APK
* This was made while I was testing the mod run, I won't be updating it continuously

# Device
* Android version: 9 or higher

# How to install
* Due to the difference in signature between the modified version and the official version, you need to uninstall the official version before you can install the modified version normally.
* **The obb** is already included in the **apks**, so just use [Split APKs Installer](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI/releases) to install it directly.

# Download
* CN
* KR (Only support real phone)
